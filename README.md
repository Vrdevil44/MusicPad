## üß† Project Vision

MusicPad is a collaborative, browser-based audio tool designed to empower users to:
- Create beats and melodies interactively using keyboard mappings
- Record loops in real-time
- Upload or record their own sound samples
- Arrange multi-layered compositions
- Export audio in downloadable formats

## üîß Core Features (Current)
- Keyboard-triggered .wav sample playback
- Real-time audio playback using JavaScript/HTML5 Audio API
- jQuery event handling for input mapping
- Sample-based beatmaking

## üöÄ Future Features (Planned)

### 1. üî¥ Recording & Playback System
Purpose: Enable users to record key presses with precise timing and playback in real-time or loops.

#### A. Track Recording
- Class: TrackRecorder
  - Captures pressed keys with relative timestamps
  - Stores multiple recorded tracks in memory

#### B. Loop Functionality
- Class: LoopManager
  - Allows creating looped sequences from recorded tracks
  - Playback can be scheduled and layered with multiple loops
  - Designed for synchronized beat performance

### 2. ‚å®Ô∏è QWERTY Layout + Sound Customization
Purpose: Enable fully customizable keys with personal samples or recorded clips

#### A. Sound Upload Interface
- Upload .wav files
- Record via microphone
- Preview selected sample

#### B. Microphone Recorder
- Uses navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() and MediaRecorder
- Captures short audio and saves it as Blob

### 3. üîÅ Looping & Sequencing
Purpose: Record, arrange, and stack multiple sequences to form structured tracks

Goals:
- Support 4-5 independent loop channels
- Drag-n-drop builder interface
- Ability to mute, solo, or rearrange loop tracks

### 4. üíæ Track Management & Exporting
Purpose: Provide tools to save sessions, reload projects, and export music

#### A. Local Storage System
- Saves track data to localStorage
- Auto-saves on every recording/edit

#### B. Export Functionality
- Uses OfflineAudioContext to mix and export .wav file
- Generates download link using Blob

### 5. üß≠ Tutorial Mode
Purpose: Onboard and educate users with interactive step-by-step guidance

#### Components:
- TutorialManager Class
- TutorialOverlay Class
- Interactive step-by-step guidance
